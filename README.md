# 💬 Rule-Based Chatbot

A simple **rule-based chatbot** built using Python.  
This chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using simple `if-else` logic.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This chatbot demonstrates the basic concept of **rule-based natural language processing** —  
it doesn’t use AI or machine learning, but rather matches keywords and phrases to provide fixed responses.

You can use this as a starting point to learn about:
- Conversation flow
- Conditional logic
- Basic text processing
